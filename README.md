Data Analyst project analyzing UrbanThreads Q4 sales and returns using Python, Pandas, Excel, and data visualization. Includes cleaned datasets, Jupyter notebook, and business insights report.

📊 UrbanThreads Q4 Sales & Returns Analysis
📌 Problem Statement

UrbanThreads, an e-commerce fashion brand, experienced a high volume of product returns in Q4.
The business wanted to understand:

Why are customers returning products?

Which categories, products, and regions contribute most to returns?

How do returns impact revenue, profit, and customer satisfaction?

What actionable steps can reduce return rates in future quarters?

This project analyzes Q4 transactional and returns data to deliver data-driven insights and business recommendations.

🧠 Approach

The analysis followed a structured end-to-end data analytics workflow:

1️⃣ Data Understanding

Examined raw sales and returns datasets

Identified missing values, inconsistencies, and incorrect data types

2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation

Removed duplicates and invalid records

Standardized categorical values (product categories, return reasons)

Created derived columns:

Return Flag

Net Revenue

Return Rate (%)

Revenue Loss due to Returns

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed sales vs returns trends

Compared return rates across:

Product categories

Regions

Order value ranges

Identified seasonal and behavioral patterns

4️⃣ KPI Calculation

Business KPIs were defined and computed to measure performance impact

5️⃣ Insight Generation & Recommendations

Translated analytical findings into clear business insights

Suggested data-backed actions to reduce return rates

📈 Key KPIs & Metrics (Recruiter Focus)
KPI	Description
Total Orders	Total number of Q4 customer orders
Total Returns	Number of returned orders
Return Rate (%)	Returns ÷ Total Orders
Gross Revenue	Revenue before returns
Revenue Loss due to Returns	Value lost from returned orders
Net Revenue	Gross Revenue − Returns
Category-wise Return Rate	Return percentage per product category
Region-wise Return Rate	Return behavior across locations
High-Risk Products	Products with abnormally high return frequency

👉 These KPIs are exactly what hiring managers expect in a real business case.

🔍 Key Business Insights
📌 1. High Return Concentration

A small number of product categories contributed to a disproportionately high return rate

Indicates issues with fit, quality, or product description accuracy

📌 2. Revenue Impact

Returns caused a significant reduction in net revenue

Certain high-value products had low volume but high revenue loss

📌 3. Regional Patterns

Specific regions showed consistently higher return rates

Suggests logistics issues, delivery delays, or mismatched customer expectations

📌 4. Order Value vs Returns

Higher order value did NOT always mean higher return rate

Mid-range priced products had the highest return frequency

💡 Business Recommendations

✔ Improve product descriptions and sizing charts for high-return categories
✔ Add quality checks for frequently returned products
✔ Introduce region-specific logistics improvements
✔ Implement return prediction flags for high-risk orders
✔ Use insights to guide inventory and marketing strategies
